### Some notes on Cloud Patforms Constellate and Binder

Constellate is available to Case Western students, staff, and faculty.  To use Constellate you will have to create a JSTOR login that is separate from your University login.  Instructions for that are here:  <a href="https://librarybeales.github.io/CreateLogin/" target=blank>Making a Constellate Account</a>.

If you are not part of Case you can launch these tutorials using the Launch Binder button.  ![A binder launch button](https://mybinder.org/static/images/badge_logo.svg)  

Any changes you make or work you complete will be deleted when closing the tab or window.  You can, however, download a copy of file you've been working in before closing the browser.
