# Digital Scholarship Workshop Series at the Kelvin Smith Library

In addition to a wide variety of in-person, hands-on, digital scholarship workshops at the Kelvin Smith Library, I provide a growing set of self-guided, interactive tutorials using python notebooks or RStudio.   

Please reach out with any questions or technical problems to David Beales, Digital Scholarship Partner, [rdb104@case.edu](mailto:rdb104@case.edu).

Here is a list of current and upcoming online resources.

### Some notes on Cloud Patforms Constellate and Binder

There are two cloud platforms that you may use to lauch these lessons in the cloud.  Most lessons will have launch buttons for both options for each lesson in the workshop.

Constellate is available to Case Western students, staff, and faculty.  To use Constellate you will have to create a JSTOR login that is separate from your University login.  Instructions for that are here:  <a href="https://librarybeales.github.io/CreateLogin/" target=blank>Making a Constellate Account</a>.

If you are not part of Case you can launch these tutorials using the Launch Binder button.  ![A binder launch button](https://mybinder.org/static/images/badge_logo.svg)  

Any changes you make or work you complete in Binder will be deleted when closing the tab or window.  You can, however, download a copy of file you've been working in before closing the browser.
